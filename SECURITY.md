## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Jaman team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: security@jaman.dev (or your actual security email)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

We follow the principle of [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).

### What to Expect

- A response to your report within 48 hours
- An assessment of the vulnerability and its impact
- A plan for patching the vulnerability
- Credit in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason
- Contact us at the email address above to report the issue as soon as possible

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow this policy.

## Security Update Process

1. The security issue is received and assigned to a primary handler
2. The handler confirms the problem and determines affected versions
3. Code is audited to find similar problems
4. Fixes are prepared for all supported releases
5. A security advisory is published along with the patched versions

## Comments on This Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request.
